## Abstract
In this report, the reader will not find a study of any kind; there is no methodology, questionnaire, interview, test, or data analysis. This report is simply a report on fractional derivatives, a topic that we have found to be fascinating.

The reader will be introduced to a short history of the topic in Chapter 1, highlighting contributions by some of the greatest mathematicians over the past three centuries. In Chapter 2, we explore the Gamma, Beta, and Mittag-Leffler functions, discussing their representations and key properties.  

Chapter 3 delves into Riemann-Liouville fractional derivatives, focusing on their properties. Chapter 4 provides a detailed discussion on the Caputo fractional derivative, comparing it with the Riemann-Liouville derivative. A proof of a crucial relationship between these two derivatives, as noted in Gorenflo and Mainardi's work, is deduced. The Leibniz rule for the Caputo operator is also derived as a corollary.

Chapter 5 showcases examples of Caputo fractional derivatives for common functions such as constants, powers, exponentials, sine, and cosine. General formulas are provided alongside proofs and visualizations of specific cases through graphs. The results are summarized in a comprehensive chart.
